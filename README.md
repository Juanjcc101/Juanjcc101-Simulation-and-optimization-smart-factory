# Simulation and optimization smart factory
For: Juan Jose Castrillon, Felipe Gomez<br>

The project "Smart Factory at Universidad EAFIT" explores the optimization of a production factory, primarily focusing on product assembly. Initiated in 2020, the project identified fluctuations in production rates and queuing times, prompting a discrete event simulation approach to better match the manufacturing process's nature. This study aims to enhance factory efficiency and reduce queuing times by modeling workstations, material management, and assembly processes. The simulation, conducted on the Simul8 platform, intends to improve factory operations, boost production, and decrease queuing times, considering the costs associated with hiring additional employees or supervisors. The project encompasses detailed modeling, including defining the problem, setting objectives, identifying inputs and outputs, and outlining the model's content. It addresses the challenge of optimizing a learning space for engineering students, providing a realistic manufacturing experience. The simulation's objective is to increase production by 5% and reduce queue time to under 50 seconds per product at each assembly station, aiming for a more efficient and effective factory operation.
